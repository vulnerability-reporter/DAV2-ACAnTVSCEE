### How to Work with Instrumented VSCode

1. Install the Application:
   - Download and install the relevant application for either Windows or macOS.
1. Start the Application:
   - Launch the application and grant full permission to trust the workspace.
1. Install Extensions:
   - Download the extension(s) from the Data-VSIX-Files/v6Extensions.zip and install them via a .vsix file installation in the extension tab of the application.
1. Monitor Network Traffic (if required):
   - Install mitmproxy to monitor external access.
   - Configure the proxy settings in the instrumented VSCode.
1. View API Access Logs:
   - Access each extension's API access logs in the /tmp/extensionLogs/ folder. Log files are created for each installed extension.
   - Note: On a Windows machine, the temporary folder will be located in the disk partition where the application is installed.

### Dynamic Analysis (Verified behavior with manual execution)

This project demonstrates the manual execution of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions, logs the extensions' actions, captures network requests using the [mitmproxy tool](https://mitmproxy.org/), and checks for suspicious extensions. Each sheet corresponds to a result section in the paper, found in the Results section "Suspicious Extensions."

When replicating these experiments, you need to [download the extensions](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1faRAX9sdzxGsrUx_dOpXsFpqdMkvzg1n) using Extension Id (ex: f2fd462f-f1bd-4c62-b54f-59a4e5ffc6a3) and run them through instrumented VS Code.

Each column in the excel sheet represents the following:

- **Id**: Unique extension ID we created to search extensions
- **Extension Name**: Extension's name
- **Usage**: VS Code marketplace page description or basic functionality
- **Download Counts**: Download count at the VS Code marketplace page
- **Comment**: Suspicious behavior of the extension
- **Transparency**: Whether they describe the actual behavior in the VS Code marketplace page
- **Flow/Logs**: mitmproxy log file (Flow), and the logs captured when executing VS Code extensions locally.
- **Sharing Reason**: Purpose of the code sharing (Only in the Code Sharing sheet)
- **Tracking Data**: Types of data used for tracking (Only in the Tracking sheet)

To demonstrate code sharing, we have used the following sample javascript code file, which you might find in the flow files:

*"const forge = require('node-forge');\r\nconst fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\n// Generate a key pair (public and private keys)\r\nconst keys = forge.pki.rsa.generateKeyPair({ bits: 2048 });\r\n\r\n// Convert the keys to PEM format (for demonstration purposes)\r\nconst privateKeyPem = forge.pki.privateKeyToPem(keys.privateKey);\r\nconst publicKeyPem = forge.pki.publicKeyToPem(keys.publicKey);\r\n\r\n// Save the keys to files (in practice, keep these keys secure)\r\nfs.writeFileSync('private\_key.pem', privateKeyPem, 'utf8');\r\nfs.writeFileSync('public\_key.pem', publicKeyPem, 'utf8');\r\nconsole.log('Keys generated and saved.');\r\n\r\n// Function to sign a message\r\nfunction signMessage(privateKey, message) {\r\n const md = forge.md.sha256.create();\r\n md.update(message, 'utf8');\r\n const signature = privateKey.sign(md);\r\n return signature;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Function to verify a signature\r\nfunction verifySignature(publicKey, message, signature) {\r\n const md = forge.md.sha256.create();\r\n md.update(message, 'utf8');\r\n return publicKey.verify(md.digest().getBytes(), signature);\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst message = 'This is a signed message';\r\n\r\n// Sign the message using the private key\r\nconst privateKey = forge.pki.privateKeyFromPem(fs.readFileSync('private\_key.pem', 'utf8'));\r\nconst signature = signMessage(privateKey, message);\r\n\r\nconsole.log('Message:', message);\r\nconsole.log('Signature:', signature);\r\n\r\n// Verify the signature using the public key\r\nconst publicKey = forge.pki.publicKeyFromPem(fs.readFileSync('public\_key.pem', 'utf8'));\r\nconst isSignatureValid = verifySignature(publicKey, message, signature);\r\n\r\nif (isSignatureValid) {\r\n console.log('Signature is valid.');\r\n} else {\r\n console.log('Signature is not valid.');\r\n}\r\n\r\n"*
